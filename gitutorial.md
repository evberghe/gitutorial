# gitutorial

Trying to come to grips with Git, Github, EGit and StatET.

After installing the last version of Eclipse ('Neon Release (4.6.0)'), wanted to start using git and Github for real. I used git before - in several different context, but always from the command line, never from within Eclipse. In previous versions of Eclipse (used 3.8 for a long time), I never managed to get it to work properly. Decided to bite the bullet now.

Eclipse package 'EGit' integrates Git within Eclipse. EGit is installed by default together with Eclipse Neon, so no need for separate installs.

I started following the EGit tutorial available on <a href='http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/tutorials/egit-tutorial/' target='_blank'>http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/tutorials/egit-tutorial/</a>. Up to their section 9 ('Revert via Reset'), everything is nice and dandy, no problems, works as advertised. when following these sections, you create a local repository, bringing all the functionality of Git - it's possible to commit, write commit messages, create branches (though that's not covered in this part of the tutorial), and revert changes to any point in your history<sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>. 

But then section 10, 'Cloning Repositories', comes a bit as a surprise - I was expecting instruction on how to push the test repository to github; instead the authors explain how to create a fresh repository on github, and how to download that to a local repository. Followed section 10 of the tutorial, downloading one of my existing projects (the <a href='https://github.com/evberghe/harmonograph' target='_blank'>harmonograph</a>) to a local repository. I downloaded to a directory that was a subdirectory of an existing project. Worked, but apparently Eclipse doesn't recognise the newly created directory as a repository directory in the project browser- there are no repository 'decorations' on the icons of the directory or its contents; and right-clicking doesn't give me the right context menu. Everything is fine, however, in the 'Git Repositories' window.

## notes

<b id="f1">1</b> For non-eclipse users: Eclipse also builds its own history file - it is always possible to compare recent versions of scripts with older versions, in a neat side-by-side view of old <i>vs</i> new, with plenty of tools to merge the content of the two versions. Git uses the same side-by-side views as core-Eclipse. Using Git, we basically have an unlimited history of our own edits, and can also compare our version of the scripts with edits done by others.[â†©](#a1)
